# Detection-of-fake-user-profiles

Upload the two csv files in python notebook when running the code.

Implemented both Random Forest Classifier and SVC models to detect accuracy.

Used GridSearchCV to get best set of hyperparameters for SVC.

Also deleted some features which are not suitable for detection (called Feature Engineering) and analysed the results using confusion matrix, f1 score, recall, accuracy, precision etc.

Achieved accuracy of 99.11 percent using SVC.
